    </h2> 
    <br><br><br>Mayer considered skipping college to pursue his music,
    but his parents dissuaded him.
    <p>He enrolled in the Berklee College of Music in 1997 at age 19.
    At the urging of his college friend Clay Cook,
    they left Berklee after two semesters and moved to Atlanta.
    There, they formed a two-man band called LoFi Masters,
    and began performing in local coffee houses and club venues
    such as Eddie's Attic.</p><p>According to Cook,
    they experienced musical differences due to Mayer's desire
    to move more towards pop music.
    The two parted ways and Mayer embarked on a solo career.</p>

    With the help of local producer and engineer Glenn Matullo, Mayer recorded the independent EP Inside Wants Out. The EP includes eight songs with Mayer on lead vocals and guitars. For the opening track, "Back To You", a full band was enlisted, including the EP's co-producer David "DeLa" LaBruyere on bass guitars.[27] Cook had co-written many of the album's songs, including its first commercial single release, "No Such Thing",[26] However, his only performance contribution was backing vocals on the song "Comfortable".
